Attempt to simplify / streamline my 3dprinter usage.

1. GCode sender with progress reports
2. Basic web UI to move the print head/bed.
3. Cura plugin to output the gcode via SFTP/HTTP.

Considering:
- Trigger system? Notifications on progress, start, stop
- Custom GCode headers - cleaning nozzle / aligning bed.
